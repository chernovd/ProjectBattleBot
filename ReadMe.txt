Battles:

- Follow the line (Automatic)
- Football (Manual)
- Sumo (Manual)
-Obstacle course (Automatic)

Requirements for the automatic battles:

We need to make sure that when the robot stops, coordinates are sent to the server so that other robots can see the coordinates and 
also recreate them. 

Robots should be connected by Bluetooth to ther server so we need to establish a connection to the server by a script (Probably on 
Pyhton).

Dashboard group will do a control in a page so we can move the robot whereever we want to move it. Cannot use an mobile app so it needs
to be on a website which should connect to the computer and from there make the robot move. 

To connect the robot via bluetooth use the code uploaded in GitHub. This should work but it has some requirements so for example: 

you need:

the robot,
yer laptop,
and terminal (termite or hyper terminal)

you do
plug the robot in
connect to it's bluetooth, name is b(no of robot), robot 11 is "b11"

the pairing password is 1234 before you pair you have to open the device manager, and see your COM ports
after you've connected there will be 2 new ones
you have to open the terminal, 
and select one of the two (one of them will most likely crash Termite, but you can restart and chose the other one)
